# PyOEIS3

PyOEIS3 is a module for interfacing with the [Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](http://oeis.org)

PyOEIS provides several methods to search the `Online
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences with Python (OEIS)
<http://www.oeis.org>`\_. It also allows for access
the information contained within individual sequence
entries, obtained by the querying methods
provided.

It is a fork of [PyOEIS](https://github.com/whonut/PyOEIS), which is no longer maintained and is incompatible
with modern versions of python3 because it relies on a deprecated tool for building python 3 modules from
python2 source code. Thanks to @whonut for the original module, but I'm releasing a modern variant.

## Installation

The easiest way to install is with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/).

    $ pip install pyoeis3
